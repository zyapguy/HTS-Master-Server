# HTS Master Server
 The main server repository for House Thief Simulator.

 THIS PROJECT IS STILL INCOMPLETE AND IS NOT READY FOR USE YET!



### Why make this open source?

We are an indie game studio and we will eventually stop supporting our older games. This will mean we will have to shut down the servers for those games to save money. This will end that games multiplayer capability forever, and we hate that. If we ever stop supporting House Thief Simulator, the community can use this source code to keep the main servers alive for as long as they want.



### How can I use this?

Any website host can host this, you can also a web server to host it. You also need a MySQL Server running.

* Download the repository
* Change the values in the data.ini file to your own, such as the MySQL Host, User and Password.
* Run the SQL file to create the necessary tables.
* Start the web server.
* Rename config.ini to config.env
* Start the main.py file.
* In the game, find the config.ini file and change SERVER_HOST to your web servers IP address.



### Editing and Modifications

You are free to modify this as much as you like, as long as you are not sending malware to people's PC's its fine! We actually suggest you modify this codebase to suit your needs!
